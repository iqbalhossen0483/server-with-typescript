# Sample Backend Project

This project serves as a sample backend implementation with the following features and technologies:

## Implementation Details

- **Authentication System**: Secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and session management.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing and managing application data.
- **Caching**: Redis is integrated to improve performance through efficient caching mechanisms.
- **Queue Management**: Bull is utilized for handling task queues and background job processing.
- **AI Integration**: Vertex AI is incorporated to leverage artificial intelligence capabilities.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety, enhances development productivity, and minimizes runtime errors.

## Key Technologies

- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.
- **MongoDB**: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database.
- **Redis**: In-memory data structure store for caching and message brokering.
- **Bull**: A powerful library for managing queues and background tasks.
- **Vertex AI**: Googleâ€™s platform for building, deploying, and scaling machine learning models.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing for better code quality and maintainability.

This backend structure is robust, scalable, and designed to handle modern application requirements efficiently.
